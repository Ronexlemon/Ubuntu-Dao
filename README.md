Ubuntu DAO is a Decentralized verification system that leverages the power of DAO and blockchain technology to enable transparent and secure consensus. It allows users to easily verify real-world scenarios online and start community initiatives.


## Inspiration
The project was inspired by the need to verify information posted online and decentralize help and good will initiatives. Online platforms are rife with fake news and misinformation, and Ubuntu DAO seeks to provide a decentralized platform for users to easily verify the authenticity of information and start initiatives to help their communities.

## What it does
Ubuntu DAO is a decentralized verification system that uses a DAO and blockchain technology to enable transparent and secure consensus. Users can submit proposals to the DAO, which is then voted on by the community using the blockchain technology to reach a transparent and secure consensus. Once the proposal is accepted, users can then verify real-world scenarios online and start community initiatives.

## How we built it
The Ubuntu DAO was built using React for the frontend and Fantom EVM to create the smart contracts. Fantom EVM is an EVM-compatible blockchain, which means that it is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to use the same development tools and smart contract programming languages as Ethereum.

## Challenges we ran into
The team faced several challenges during the development of the Ubuntu DAO. One of the biggest challenges was power outages in their home country Kenya, which affected their ability to work consistently. Deploying to the Fantom network was also challenging, as there were limited resources available on the network. The team had to spend a lot of time researching and experimenting with different deployment strategies.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the challenges faced during the development process, the team was able to work together collaboratively and remained committed to the project. The team was proud of their ability to work together despite the difficulties and create a functioning product.

## What we learned
During the development of Ubuntu DAO, the team learned a lot about EVM-compatible blockchains, such as the Fantom network. They also gained valuable experience working with smart contracts and DAOs, which will be useful in future projects.

## What's next for Ubuntu DAO
The team plans to do a beta launch and onboard the first group of users to test the application. They will use feedback from users to improve the platform and add more features, such as the ability to launch new DAOs and create more complex smart contracts. The team is excited about the potential of Ubuntu DAO and looks forward to seeing the impact it can have on decentralizing verification and community initiatives.
